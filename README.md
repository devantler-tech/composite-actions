Welcome to the DevantlerTech GitHub Actions repository! This repository contains [composite actions](#composite-actions) designed to streamline your CI/CD processes.  These actions are used across all DevantlerTech projects, ensuring consistency and efficiency.

The below diagram illustrates the relationship between GitHub Workflows and GitHub Actions.

## Composite Actions

[Composite actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/tutorials/creating-a-composite-action) are a powerful way to group multiple steps into a single action. They allow composing small, reusable components that can be used in any GitHub Actions context, e.g, within reusable workflows, standalone workflows, other composite actions, or even in other GitHub Actions.
